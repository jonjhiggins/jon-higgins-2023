> 2023: I'm currently studying a masters in Virtual and Extended Realities in order to achieve my dream of becoming a VR/XR Unity developer. âœ¨

I'm facinated by human-computer interaction, and nowhere is that interaction more interesting than XR. I would love to work in industries where there is so much potential for these new forms of interaction, such as sports, movement, health and wellness.

I look forward to applying my previous industry experience to XR, which includes 12 years of web development and 3 years of product development.
