### Personal

I recently moved back to the UK after spending 2&frac12; years in the exceptionally nice-to-live-in [Melbourne, Australia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHtFJy75FMs).

* Outside of work I try to spend as little time in front of a screen as possible. I enjoy [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/13456097), cycling and the occasional swim.
* I bloody love [music](http://www.last.fm/user/jhig_uk).
* Also keen on [travelling](https://www.instagram.com/jonjhiggins/), camping and exploring places.
