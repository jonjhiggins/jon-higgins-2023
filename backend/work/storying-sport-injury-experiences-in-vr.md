> Immerse yourself in the frustrating and exhausting world of the injured athlete in this virtual reality experience, while understanding the sports psychology that underpins their experience. Based on one of the six narratives outlined in research paper “Storying Sports Injury Experiences of Elite Track Athletes: A Narrative Analysis” (Everard, Wadey and Howells, 2021).

Although I am largely working on this project alone I also have assistance from Rebecca Evans (dramaturgy / storytelling, script writing, critical feedback), Ciara Everard (research author providing sports psychology feedbak) and feedback from course tutors Duncan Speakman and Naomi Smyth.
