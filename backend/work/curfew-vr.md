I worked as a Unity developer on this VR project as part of a cross-functional team for Calico. Together we produced an interactive 360-video headset VR experience aimed at helping Police and transport officers understand the fem experience of public space at night.

Calico are a Birmingham-based arts and activism company, co-creating artistic campaigns with local communities. They use art; live performance, short films, virtual reality experiences, to combat gendered violence.
