To start our course we were tasked with experimenting with different XR mediums, I sketched out prototypes and experiments with:

- AR: app to display nutritional info of foods
- Unity / A-Frame: simple game to compare both tools as games engines
- AI: text, image and 3D asset generation
- Web Audio API: using movement to control audio and audio to control visuals
